# 📋 Project Scope: Family-First Matrimony Platform

## 1. Executive Summary
The **Family-First Matrimony Platform** is a secure, niche web application designed to restore traditional values in the digital matchmaking space. Unlike modern dating apps or generic matrimony sites, this platform focuses strictly on **family-led matchmaking**, **verified profiles**, and **community-specific connections**.

The platform is built on the philosophy of **"Serious Intent Only"**, eliminating casual dating, fake profiles, and indefinite searching.

## 2. Core Problem Statements
- **Infinite Searching:** Users on other platforms stay for years without serious intent.
- **Fake Profiles:** Lack of strict identity checks leads to fraud.
- **Privacy Concerns:** Women’s contact details are often exposed to strangers.
- **Cultural Mismatch:** Lack of specific categorization for financial and lifestyle compatibility.

## 3. The Solution: Key Features & Rules

### ✅ A. The "Strict Age" Policy (The 20-28 Rule)
To ensure the user base remains young, active, and serious about marriage, the platform enforces hard limits:
1.  **Entry Age:** Users can only register if they are between **20 and 28 years old**.
2.  **The "Cliff" (Auto-Termination):**
    - Users act on a timeline.
    - Once a user turns **29**, their profile is **automatically terminated/hidden**.
    - This creates a sense of urgency and ensures the database is not clogged with inactive, aging profiles.

### ✅ B. Geography & Citizenship Policy
- **India Residents Only:** The platform is exclusively for people currently residing in India.
- **No NRIs:** Non-Resident Indians (NRIs) are strictly blocked from registration to maintain local community trust and easier verification.

### ✅ C. Financial Status Categorization
To enable transparent and compatible matching, users must categorize their family financial status into one of three strict levels:
1.  **Starting / Lower Middle Class:** Families beginning their financial journey.
2.  **Middle Class:** Established families with steady income.
3.  **Rich / Affluent:** High-net-worth families.
*Note: This field is mandatory and helps in filtering relevant matches.*

### ✅ D. Family-First Communication Protocol
- **No Direct Chat:** A male profile cannot directly message a female profile.
- **Guardian Control:** Accounts are managed primarily by parents or guardians.
- **Connection Workflow:**
    1.  Family A sends a "Connection Request" to Family B.
    2.  Family B reviews the profile.
    3.  If Family B accepts, **contact details are unlocked**.
    4.  Families communicate offline/over call first.

## 4. User Verification Process
Trust is the currency of this platform.
1.  **Step 1:** User submits details + Aadhaar/Govt ID.
2.  **Step 2:** Admin reviews the document.
3.  **Step 3:** Profile gets a "Verified Badge".
*Unverified profiles are invisible in search results.*

## 5. Non-Goals (Out of Scope)
- **No Dating Features:** Swiping, casual chat, and public timelines are strictly prohibited.
- **No International Support:** We are not handling international phone numbers or time zones.
- **No Remarriage Support (MVP):** The initial version focuses on first-time marriages only.
